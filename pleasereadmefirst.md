# Web-a-thon
We have done research and found that there are not many websites that are providing real time feeds for cyber incidents,research and data. The remaining website that are providing real time feeds for cyber incidents,research and data have many problems and setbacks that are listed below:

1.) The websites are very clustered and not very user friendly
2.) A person have to spend a lot of time to find information  
3.) The websites do not provide information about every sector 
4.) Majority of the websites do not provide detailed information 
5.) There are no views of professional and cybersecurity analyst on those websites

Solution of the Problem:First we are going to make our website more user friendly so that both layman and professional cybersecurity analyst can use the website easily. We are going to provide as much as detailed information possible in real time using machine learning . We are going to make a section for professionals and cybersecurity analyst to share their views on the website by giving them permission to write their researches and views on our websites and all other people to comment on the articles and share their personal views . We are going to use technologies like HTML, CSS , JavaScript, Reactjs, APIs, Machine Learning and many more technologies with advancement of our website
