Extract features from the collected text data including keywords, entities like organisation name or malware types
and topics using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques:

Code for extraction:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample text data
documents = ["scrapped_data.db"]

# Create the vectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

# Get feature names and their scores
feature_names = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
scores = X.toarray()

# Print keywords and their scores for each document
for doc_index, doc_scores in enumerate(scores):
    print(f"Document {doc_index}:")
    for word_index in doc_scores.argsort()[-10:]:
        print(f"  {feature_names[word_index]}: {doc_scores[word_index]}")
